# STEP 1
Load the Network - .prototxt contains the arhcitecture of the neural network. In this case the neural network consists of 10 layers of VGGNET and then a 2-branch multi-stage CNN. This architecture won the COCO keypoints challenge in 2016 by the Perceptual Lab at Carnegie Mellon University - .caffemodel file stores the weights of the trained model.
